				Hey C,<br><br>
				I think this will be one of the last updates I will make to the site.
				I have a couple more ideas but they are quite hard to implement and we don't 
				have much time apart left, which is a good thing just not in that respect.
				It has been a long run we've been apart and we're now over half way. I am finding
				myself checking this website more and more as the time ticks away, eager for it to reach zero.
				The next tab I have added contains songs either you have introduced me to or ones that I associate with
				us. If you want we can create a joint playlist and put it on here instead but this is just a start.
				This definitely hasn't been easy but it'll all be worth it when I fly out to see you.<br>
				Love, Sam
				<br><br>
