				Hi Carmen,<br><br>
				Considering the Royal Mail can't send letters properly I thought I'd leave you a note here.
				I have been missing you so much since you left. In case you couldn't tell from the website.
				This website is starting to properly fill out with some cool stuff that I think you'd like.
				This isn't the final update however, there's still at least one more to come and potentially
				some more if I'm good enough to finish it. I am glad that although I'm not with you right now,
				I'm able to work on this to let you know how much you mean to me.<br>
				Love, Sam
				<br><br>
